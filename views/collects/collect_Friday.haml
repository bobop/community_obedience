      Lord Jesus, in your servant Francis
      %br
      you displayed the wonderful power of the cross: 
      %br
      help us always to follow you in the way of the cross, 
      %br
      and give us strength to resist all temptation, 
      %br
      and to you, Lord, with the Father and the Holy Spirit 
      %br
      be all glory for ever. Amen.
